    "Overfitting means that model we trained has trained “too well” and is now, well, fit too closely to the training dataset. This usually happens when the model is too complex i.e. too many features/variables compared to the number of observations. This model will be very accurate on the training data but will probably be very not accurate on untrained or new data. It is because this model is not generalized, meaning you can generalize the results and can’t make any inferences on other data, which is, ultimately, what you are trying to do. Basically, when this happens, the model learns or describes the “noise” in the training data instead of the actual relationships between variables in the data. This noise, obviously, isn’t part in of any new dataset, and cannot be applied to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Underfitting\n",
    "In contrast to overfitting, when a model is underfitted, it means that the model does not fit the training data and therefore misses the trends in the data. It also means the model cannot be generalized to new data. This is usually the result of a very simple model which does not have enough predictors/independent variables. It could also happen when, for example, we fit a linear model ,like linear regression to data that is not linear. It almost goes without saying that this model will have poor predictive ability on training data and can’t be generalized to other data.\n"
